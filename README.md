# Phil Davis

Hello! I'm a self taught devleoper looking to build cool projects and get better at coding. Luckily there's a lot of synergy in those two goals.




## Interests
- **Python**  My primary coding language
- **Birdwatching**  If you are also working on a project involving eBird, I'd love to hear about it.
- **3D Modeling and visualization** I've been doing it for over a decade. 

## Projects
- **New Bird City**  A tool to help birdwatchers plan and prepare for trips.
- **Weatherpls** A no frills CLI tool for getting weather forcasts.

# Phil Davis

Hello! I'm a self taught devleoper looking to build cool projects and get better at coding. Luckily there's a lot of synergy in those two goals.


## Projects
Here are some of the interesting ones
- **[json_memoize](https://github.com/phildavis17/json_memoize)** A tool for light-duty persistent memoization.
- **[New Bird City](https://github.com/phildavis17/New_Bird_City)**  A tool I'm developing to help birdwatchers plan and prepare for trips.
- **[weatherpls](https://github.com/phildavis17/weatherpls)** A no frills CLI tool for getting weather forcasts.
- **[Writer](https://github.com/phildavis17/Writer)** A deliberately simple writing tool. Focus on the important part (writing) not the other stuff.


## Interests
- **Python**  My primary coding language.
- **Birdwatching**  If you are also working on a project involving eBird, I'd love to hear about it. Also [here](http://brooklynbirdclub.org/ClapperRail/Clapper_Rail_Summer_2018.pdf) is an article I got published about it. (The Sparks! column, on page 17)
- **Woodworking** I've been building furniture since 2014
- **Rendering and 3D Printing** I've been doing it for over a decade. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekt-1YH4CDs&t=465s) is a talk I gave about it. (My portion beins at about 4:50)

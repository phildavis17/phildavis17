# Phil Davis

Hello! I'm a self taught devleoper looking to build cool projects and get better at coding. Luckily there's a lot of synergy in those two goals.




## Interests
- **Python**  My primary coding language
- **Birdwatching**  If you are also working on a project involving eBird, I'd love to hear about it.
- **3D Modeling and visualization** I've been doing it for over a decade.

## Projects
Here are some of the interesting ones
- **[json_memoize](https://github.com/phildavis17/json_memoize)** A tool for light-duty persistent memoization.
- **[New Bird City](https://github.com/phildavis17/New_Bird_City)**  A tool I'm developing to help birdwatchers plan and prepare for trips.
- **[weatherpls](https://github.com/phildavis17/weatherpls)** A no frills CLI tool for getting weather forcasts.
- **[Writer](https://github.com/phildavis17/Writer)** A deliberately simple writing tool. Focus on the important part (writing) not the other stuff.
